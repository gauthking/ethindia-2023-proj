## Powerhouse of Privacy and Participation: zk-enforced Anonymity & AI-Assured Quorum

## What It Solves
As college students steering the university DAO, we have identified critical challenges hindering optimal DAO functionality:

- ***Anonymity Gap***: Existing DAOs lack a mechanism for voter anonymity, compromising user privacy.
- ***Quorum Deficiency***: High instances of proposals failing to reach quorum hinder effective decision-making.

*Supported by findings from [research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09822.pdf), revealing a meager 5% average participation per proposal, these issues underscored the need for innovation.*

In response, we proudly present **zXdao**, pioneering a transformative approach to **unlock the full potential of DAOs**.

## Our Solutions

- ***AI-Driven Participation***: Leveraging VADER and traditional Machine Learning, we construct a behavioral model of each user through sentiment analysis. In cases where users fail to vote by the proposal deadline, our AI acts on their behalf, ensuring continuous and representative participation.
- ***zk Anonymity***: Employing cutting-edge zk proofs and the Semaphore protocol, we introduce robust anonymity measures. Users validate their identity commitment by being part of the DAO. This process empowers users or their corresponding AI to vote securely from any wallet, supported by a comprehensive zk proof.

## zXdao Impact

- ***Enhanced Participation***: By addressing the anonymity concern, zXdao fosters a more inclusive environment, encouraging higher engagement and participation.
- ***Quorum Assurance***: AI-driven voting mitigates the risk of proposals failing to achieve quorum, promoting effective decision-making within the DAO.
